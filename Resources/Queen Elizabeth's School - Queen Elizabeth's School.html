Thanks go to Binu Perera (2012-19), who conducted another zoom talk for us last Friday, this time with a small group of our Year 13 boys, discussing the Cambridge interview process for Medicine. The Q&amp;A included interview advice, how to demonstrate an interest in Medicine during lockdown and information about life at Cambridge, where he is studying.

Vebushan Sukumar (Y13) commented: “What a wonderful experience - insightful and fulfilling. The advice on the necessary A-level content for the interview was especially useful. I would definitely recommend this to any aspiring medics applying to Cambridge - it is a fantastic opportunity to answer your concerns and build confidence surrounding the selection process.”

Their impartial reviews are influential among prospective parents – selecting those they believe to be among the best schools nationally to feature.

We were proud that QE was praised in all aspects - from public examination results being “right in the top branches of the academic league table tree” to music, sport and drama - with a conclusion that the School offers “an exceptional and rounded education”.

The report notes that nearly all leavers go to Russell Group universities. There is a mention for our alumni, with reviewers praising QE Connect, our networking platform linking current pupils with old boys happy to help them with work experience, internships, mock interviews and mentoring. And the behaviour of the boys gets a special mention – being “among the most courteous we’ve met”.

The Headmaster commented: “This is a very positive review indeed, which captures many of the things that make Queen Elizabeth’s School a state school like no other. It is always gratifying to read third-party appreciation of what we are doing, particularly from GSG, whose reviewers do not mince their words if things are not up to scratch!”

The full review is available on the @goodschoolsguide subscription website and will be published in forthcoming print editions.

Teachers spoke with parents via Schoolcloud, to discuss the progress of our Year 13 students as they tackle their crucial final year at QE.

Head of Chemistry, Dr Lister (pictured), commented: “Meeting parents online meant we could still maintain important contact during these times. The online system enabled the evening to proceed successfully and efficiently.”

We will be using this format for all this term’s parent consultation and review evenings, and staff look forward to meeting QE parents in this new adapted way.

“At the going down of the sun and in the morning,
We will remember them.”

Our Ambassador, Aadarsh Khimasia (Year 12), is contributing to this week’s Youth Climate Summit, a virtual festival of themed discussions and activities for school age students across the UK, designed to raise awareness of sustainability issues. We were proud to see Aadarsh feature in the promotional video!

Coordinated by the charity Global Action Plan, and supported by organisations such as Greenpeace, the WWF and Oxford University, the aim of the Summit is to empower students to create a more sustainable and healthy future for the planet.

Our Charity Coordinator, Mr King, commented: “I’m incredibly proud of Aadarsh, who is using his talents in difficult circumstances, to raise awareness of the climate crisis, and our role in combatting it.”

They learnt about the “Communication Triangle” and gained insights into overcoming nerves, as well as how to listen and give constructive feedback to each other. The boys were given time to apply these skills in building their own speeches from scratch, which they then performed to the group.

Mr O’Gorman, who organised the day, described it as a “Fantastic opportunity for a select group of Year 10 boys to develop their confidence speaking in front of their peers, as well as learning some top tips for public speaking.”

Our thanks go to Guest Speaker Hari Kalymnios from @jackpetcheyfoundation, for delivering such a motivating and informative workshop.

Art teacher Ms Nicodemus, who runs the Year 7 Drawing Club (pictured), commented “It is great to encourage the boys to express their creativity and independence, which will grow throughout their time at QE.” She also runs the Y7-9 Manga Club (Year 8s pictured), which “gives the boys a feeling of being part of a group with shared interests; a place to enjoy some quiet time and time to feel grounded.”⁣

We will of course be marking the occasion next Wednesday, albeit in an adapted way this year.

These have been conducted online this year, via Zoom, due to the current restrictions in place. The interviews have been largely set up via QE Connect, where a significant number of Old Elizabethans have indicated their willingness to provide a mock interview to current boys.

Zac Howlett-Davies (OE 2006-13, pictured) interviewed Zeke Essex, who is applying to read Modern Languages at Corpus Christi, Cambridge; Zeke remarked that Zac gave him “excellent feedback based on his own experiences - it was great practice before the real thing”.

Assistant Head (Pupil Development) Mike Feven commented &quot;I am hugely grateful for the longstanding support from our Old Elizabethan community and from other Friends of the School, who each year so generously give up their time to support our Year 13 students in this way. Whilst we are disappointed not to be able to hold our Mock Interview Evening in person this year, the value of these interviews in supporting boys with their university applications cannot be understated.&quot;

The University Entrance Exams begin today, and we wish all our boys every success in the process.

Each tutor group was assigned a state and their votes were counted accordingly. When the polls closed yesterday, the result was overwhelmingly in favour of the Democrats, winning 444 of the 538 Electoral College votes.

Another clear winner was today’s US themed lunch! Going stateside, the boys enjoyed cheeseburgers with pickles and onion rings, spicy bean burgers, classic or vegan hotdogs, sweet potato fries, street slaw and a milkshake - with cream soda cans and popcorn also available.

As we await the real result, check out the rest of our election activity on eQE, including a political podcast and a fascinating ‘Trump-Biden’ video debate, produced by our Y12 boys.

The award was presented by Mr Martin Russell, the Queen’s Representative Deputy Lieutenant for Barnet (himself a former QE parent who continues to give great support to the School).

Dhruv is the author of 21 books on Hinduism and has given over 340 public talks on spirituality, with audiences including the British Army, House of Commons, House of Lords, the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police, to name a few.

On receiving the award, Dhruv said “I am honoured and humbled to receive this recognition from the Queen. I hope that this inspires many young [people] to take up volunteering service to the community.”

All QE boys have been sent an invitation via eQE, with instructions on how to participate in their year group tournament - you do not need to attend Chess Club to take part.

The tournament is expected to conclude in 90 minutes and will consist of 4 games. Good luck to all participants!

Meanwhile, we wish all our boys and the wider QE community a relaxing half term. Keep well and we’ll see you in November.
