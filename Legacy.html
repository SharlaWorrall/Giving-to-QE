    <h1>Leaving a Legacy</h1>
    <div class="option1">

    <p class="projects">

    Leaving a legacy to the school in your will is a way to make a gift without impacting current 
    income, and can have tax advantages while you provide for your family and others through
    your estate.  We will be pleased to honour your wishes as to which school project you would
    like to support.  We do understand that circumstances change. You do not need to let us know
    the value of your planned gift and it will not represent a binding commitment. 
    Making a will is a very personal matter and we assure you that your plans will be held in the 
    strictest confidence.  

    If you intend to make a bequest, or have already made provisions in your will for the school, 
    please download and return the form below, or get in touch with the Development and let us know
    you are thinking of us. You only need share the details you wish to with us, and we are always 
    very grateful to hear from you.

    <h1>Reduce your inheritance tax bill</h1>

    <div class="option1">

    <p class="projects">
    
    Gifts to Queen Elizabeths's School are exempt from Inheritance Tax (IHT) in the UK, and 
    there is now a further incentive when you leave 10% or more of your net estate to charity.
    
    If you leave charitable gifts in your will that amount to 10% or more of your chargeable 
    net estate, the IHT rate on the whole of your estate will be reduced from 40% to 36%.
    
    The following is an example of how this would work in practice for a gross estate 
    of £1,000,000:</p>

</div>

<div class="option1">
    <table class="iht">
        <tr>
            <th>Without a charitable bequest</th>
            <th></th>
            <th>With a 10% charitable bequest</th>
            <th></th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <th>Gross estate</th>
            <th>£1,000,000</th>
            <th>Gross estate</th>
            <th>£1,000,000</th>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <th> Less nil band</th>
            <th>(-£325,000)</th>
            <th> Less nil band</th>
            <th>(-£325,000)</th>
               
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <th>Net estate </th>
            <th>£675,000</th>
            <th>Net estate </th>
            <th>£675,000</th>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <th>No charitable donation</th>
            <th>£0</th>
            <th>Less bequest of 10% </th>
            <th>(-£67,500)</th>
        </tr>
        
           
        <tr>
            <th>Taxable estate</th>
            <th>£675,000 </th>
            <th>Taxable estate</th>
            <th>£607,500</th>
        </tr>
        
           
        <tr>
            <th>Less IHT at 40%</th>
            <th> (-£270,000)</th>
            <th>Less IHT at 36%	</th>
            <th>(-£218,700)</th>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <th>Remaining estate (incl. nil rate band)</th>
            <th>£730,000 </th>
            <th>Remaining estate (incl. nil rate band)</th>
            <th>£713,800</th>
        </tr>
        

        
    </table>
</div>    

   
   <p class="projects"> Therefore the estate’s beneficiaries forego the sum of £16,200; but the
    charity or charities would benefit from £67,500.
