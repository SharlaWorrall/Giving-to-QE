    <p class="Founder-text">Bringing up and instruction of boys and youth, to be brought up in grammar
      and other learning, and the same to continue for ever, and the said School
      for one Master and one Usher for ever to continue and remain and that there 
      shall be for ever four-and-twenty discreet, honest governors.</p>   

    <p class="projects"> Members of the 1573 Society give a regular gift via direct debit. 
    We are keen for Society members to be recognised by having their name 
    handwritten in calligraphy in the Queen Elizabeth's School Endowment Book – 
    which they will also be offered the opportunity to sign and will 
    be on display in the school Archive.

    Each year, members will be invited to the Master’s events and an 
    annual Benefactors Garden Party, in addition to receiving a special 
    lapel pin. </p>
